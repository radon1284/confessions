<h1>About Jack Kinsella</h1>
<h2>Professional Activities</h2>
<p>Immediately after college, I built <a href="http://www.oxbridgenotes.co.uk">Oxbridge Notes</a>, a highly automated niche marketplace for college notes. Although I retain full ownership, I am no longer operationally involved with the business, having delegated management to a dedicated team. </p>
<p> I was also involved with creating a "real world" organisation through having co-founded <a href="http://www.bolivianexpress.org">Bolivian Express</a>, Bolivia's largest English language magazine. I lived in Bolivia during this time and we won the praise of president Evo Morales for our efforts.</p>

    I write <%= link_to "books", books_path %>, which are available on this website.

<h3>Music</h3>
Had I been born in the days before computers, my clumsy fingers and amateur technique would have prohibited me from toying around with music production. But thanks to the democratic magic of DAWs, I am lucky enough to be able to write downbeat electronic music for fun. My influences are Radiohead, Burial, Aphex Twin, Booka Shade, James Holden, Luke Abbott, Moderat, The Beatles, The Knife, Deadmau5, Chopin, and good ol' Bach. I am open to collaborating on projects with musicians, singers, and lyricists who have similar tastes.

<h2> Education</h2>
<p>I studied law at Oxford, where I graduated in 2009. Since graduation, I dedicate time every day to teach myself whatever catches my fancy, which as of late has been computer programming, rhetoric, and German.</p>
