<h1>About Jack Kinsella</h1>
<h2>Professional Activities</h2>
<p>Immediately after college, I built <a href="http://www.oxbridgenotes.co.uk">Oxbridge Notes</a>, a highly automated niche marketplace for college notes. Although I retain full ownership, I am no longer operationally involved with the business, having delegated management to a dedicated team. </p>
<p> I was also involved with creating a "real world" organisation through having co-founded <a href="http://www.bolivianexpress.org">Bolivian Express</a>, Bolivia's largest English language magazine. I lived in Bolivia during this time.</p>
<p>
    I write <%= link_to "books", books_path %>, which are available on this website.

<h3>Music</h3>
For fun, I like to write downbeat electronic music. My influences are Radiohead, Burial, Aphex Twin, Booka Shade, James Holden, Luke Abbott, Moderat, The Beatles, The Knife, Deadmau5, Chopin, and good ol' Bach. I am open to collaborating on projects with musicians, singers, and lyricists who have similar tastes.

<h2> Education</h2>
    <p>I studied law at Oxford, where I graduated in 2009. Since graduation, I dedicate time every day to teach myself whatever catches my fancy, which as of late has been computer programming, rhetoric, and German.</p>
