This a repository for the distribution platform of the book - "[Entreprenerd: The Busy Person's Primer on SEO, Paid Advertising, and Conversion Optimisation](https://www.jackkinsella.ie/books/entreprenerd-seo-paid-advertising-and-conversion-optimisation)" by Jack Kinsella and Jack's personal website. You can check the current live version of the application here - https://www.jackkinsella.ie/

### Running it locally

Please take a look at the ```docs/development_setup.md``` file.

### Why open source?

Our primary business value comes from the book and the application is just a distribution platform for it, so we are not afraid of "someone stealing our ideas". Moreover, we hope that we will get some social media recognition for developing the application in public (so please share it with your friends!)
